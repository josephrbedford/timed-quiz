# README - Timed Quiz

Birmingham coding bootcamp week four challenge was to create a timed quiz.

## Description

The quiz game needed to run a timer when the start button was clicked, present the user with a new question when the old one was answered, and subtract time from the clock when a question was answered incorrectly. Finally when all questions were answered or the timer reached 0 it needed to end the game, and allow the user to save initials and score.
